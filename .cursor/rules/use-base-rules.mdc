# Use Base Development Rules

All AI agents working on this project must follow the comprehensive development rules and guidelines defined in:

**ðŸ“‹ [.agents/rules/base.md](.agents/rules/base.md)**

## Key Directive

- **Single Source of Truth**: All development rules, coding standards, testing practices, and workflow requirements are maintained in `base.md`
- **No Rule Duplication**: Do not reference or follow other rule files - `base.md` contains the complete and authoritative rule set
- **Always Current**: `base.md` is the actively maintained configuration - other rule files may be outdated

## What's Included in base.md

- Core development principles (TDD, OOP, baby steps)
- Code quality and coverage requirements  
- Testing implementation rules (pytest, expects, doublex)
- Makefile targets usage
- Style guidelines and output formatting
- Process requirements and mental preparation
- Documentation standards

## Compliance

Before starting any development work, agents must:
1. Read and understand all rules in `base.md`
2. Follow the contemplation and TDD processes defined there
3. Use the specified tools, testing frameworks, and make targets
4. Maintain the required code quality standards

**Remember**: `base.md` is the complete development rulebook for this project.
