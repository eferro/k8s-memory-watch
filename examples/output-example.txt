=== Memory Usage Analysis ===
🚨 Found 4 potential issues:

1. Pod kube-system/etcd-master is using 120.5% of its memory request
2. Pod default/memory-hog-pod is using 95.0% of its memory request  
3. Pod production/worker-high-memory is using 94.6% of its memory request
4. Pod production/redis-cache-789 has no memory request defined

🔥 High Memory Usage Pods (3):
  🟢 kube-system/etcd-master [Running/Ready] | Usage: 120.5 MB | Request: 100.0 MB (120.5%) | Limit: N/A (N/A)
  🔴 default/memory-hog-pod [Running/NotReady] | Usage: 950.2 MB | Request: 1000.0 MB (95.0%) | Limit: 1024.0 MB (92.8%)
  🔴 production/worker-high-memory [Running/Ready] | Usage: 756.9 MB | Request: 800.0 MB (94.6%) | Limit: 1000.0 MB (75.7%)

⚠️  Warning Level Pods (1):
  🟢 monitoring/prometheus-server-456def789 [Running/Ready] | Usage: 180.4 MB | Request: 200.0 MB (90.2%) | Limit: 400.0 MB (45.1%)

📋 Recommendations:
• Set memory limits for 8 pods to prevent OOM kills and resource contention
• Set memory requests for 5 pods to enable proper scheduling  
• Monitor 3 high-usage pods closely - consider scaling or optimization
• Regular monitoring recommended with current threshold: 80.0%

SYMBOL EXPLANATION:
==================

🟢 = Pod Running and Ready
🔴 = Pod with issues (high memory usage or not Ready)  
🟡 = Pod Pending
⚪ = No memory metrics available (pod starting up or metrics not ready)

POD FORMAT:
===========
[Status] namespace/pod-name [Phase/ReadyStatus] | Usage: [current memory] | Request: [requested] ([% usage vs request]) | Limit: [limit] ([% usage vs limit])

DATA SHOWN:
===========
- Phase/ReadyStatus: Pod phase (Running, Pending, etc.) and ready state (Ready/NotReady)
- Usage: RAM currently used by the pod
- Request: Memory the pod requested from the cluster (% = current usage / request * 100)
- Limit: Maximum memory limit allowed (% = current usage / limit * 100)
- N/A: Not defined (no request or limit configured)
